The **MXChip IoT DevKit** is an all-in-one Arduino compatible board with rich peripherals and sensors. You can develop for it using the Visual Studio Code IoT Tools and Arduino extension. And it comes with a growing projects catalog to guide you prototype Internet of Things (IoT) solutions that take advantage of Microsoft Azure services.

First we need to configure the device and get all the dependencies installed and setup.

1. Plug the MXChip into the PC with the provided USB cable. It should show a green light to say its connected and display the current firmware version. 

1. Check the sensors are all working - pressing the B button will cycle through the various sensors on the device. The sensors and their readings will be displayed on the little screen.
