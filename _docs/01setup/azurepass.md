We will now setup your Azure Pass Subscription, this will require a **brand new Microsoft Account** as you can only have one Azure Pass/Trial on a Microsoft Account in its lifetime. If you are going to use your own Azure subscription you can skip this part and continue with the lab when prompted by the instructor.

Please follow the below instructions **exactly as they are**. It is possible to invalidate the pass on a Microsoft Account resulting in having to create a brand new account and use a new subscription redemption code.

1. Open Microsoft Edge and launch a New InPrivate Window, this can be done by clicking the three dots at the top right of the browser window.

1. Go to [outlook.com](https://outlook.com) and create a new account.
