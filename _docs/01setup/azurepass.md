We now need to get your Azure Pass setup, This will require a clean Microsoft Account. If you are going to use your own Azure subscription you can skip this part and continue with the lab when prompted by the instructor.

If you are going to use the Azure Pass provided, please follow these instructions **ABSOLUTELY TO THE LETTER**. Please read each step twice, before you do it. This is eminently important: it's possible to lock yourself out of your free subscription or create scenarios where the pass "is already in use", where you get a message saying the "pass is not associated with this account" and about a dozen variants of these basic ideas. If you follow these instructions **TO THE LETTER WITH NO STEPS SKIPPED OR ALTERNATIVE STEPS TAKEN** (because "I can see what he means, but there's no need to do that – I know what I'm doing") – then you will have success. It'll take you less than 5 minutes and you'll have started the Azure lab work while others are still trying to activate their subscriptions.

You can only assign one free trial/Azure Pass during the entire life of a Microsoft Account. Therefore, **avoid using an existing Microsoft Account**. We've come across it many times where people took out a trial in 2008 and have completely forgotten all about it. You'll only get an error message saying you can't do that.
